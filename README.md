### 👻 &nbsp;&nbsp;How and Why I Became a Developer

I had been trying to teach myself to program for a couple years but it wasn't until COVID-19 hit that I really devoted myself to it. I decided to attend an accelerated software development program with Code Fellows. It was here that I really fell in love with software.

The reason behind my motivation is pretty simple. I, of course, want to build a better life for family, friends, and those around me but on a personal level, I am tired of living in a world where the rules are decided by others. I want to become one of the creators that shape how society interacts with one another. I want to create and foster a world that everyone wants to live and thrive in. I believe tech is one of the best ways to make an impact on society as a single person.
